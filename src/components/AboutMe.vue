                >Welcome to Oleksiy's World! Hello there! I'm Oleksiy, the
                creator and curator behind this little corner of the internet.
                As a Fullstack Web Developer, I've embarked on a journey to
                share my experiences, insights, and a bit of my personality with
                you.

                A Brief Introduction: Since childhood, I have been interested in
                new technologies and devices, thus discovering the possibilities
                of a PC and surfing the Internet. This is how I discovered
                programming. My interest boiled down to the development of
                various kinds of web applications and the driving force behind
                the creation of this space. With a background in computing, I've
                found a unique combination of skills and interests that I can't
                wait to share with you.

                Embarking on the Journey: The idea for this website sprouted
                from my own journeyâ€”filled with twists, turns, and moments. It's
                my hope that by sharing my experiences, i can interest you in me
                as a developer, for future cooperation.
